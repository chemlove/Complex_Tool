Usage:
======

./Complex_Contact <complex_file> <contact_out>
                <CAorCB> <radius> <resi_thres>
[note]: complex_file should be official 4-digit PDB file.
[note]: CAorCB, use CA [=1] or CB [=0] to calculate contact.
        radius, within the radius for contact. (set to 8.0)
        resi_thres, inner contact residue separation (set to 6)
[note]: in this version, we consider MISS residue with repect to SEQRES
